This Python project analyzes and visualizes Air Quality Index (AQI) data to monitor air pollution levels in different cities or regions. The project provides insights into air quality trends, pollution peaks, and main pollutants. Optionally, it can also predict future AQI values based on historical data.

Features
-Fetch AQI data from APIs or load historical datasets.
-Clean and preprocess data for analysis.
-Calculate average AQI per city/day/month.
-Categorize AQI levels (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy).
-Visualize data using line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps.
Optional: Predict future AQI using time series or regression models.
-Generate actionable insights for health and environmental awareness.
